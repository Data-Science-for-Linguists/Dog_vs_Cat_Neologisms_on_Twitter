## What this repo includes:
- An ipynb file ([Doggos-vs-Kittehs](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/Jupyter-Notebooks/Doggos-vs-Kittehs.ipynb)) -and a md file of the same thing - that shows data collection and the some analysis of the data
- A second ipynb file ([Doggos-vs-Kittehs-Part2](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/Jupyter-Notebooks/Doggos-vs-Kittehs-Part2.ipynb))  - and a md file of the same thing -  which is an extension of the first.
- An old ipynb file ([Project]()) that is an older version of the first file listed above
- a [progress report](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/progress_report.md) of when I worked on things
- a [LIVE_data_collection](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/Jupyter-Notebooks/LIVE_data_collection.ipynb) ipynb file that let's you put in your own customerKey and customerSecret as well as topics to see how my data cleaning and part of my analysis works with a small dataset
- [LICENSE file](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/LICENSE.md) that describes the licensing for this repo
- [LICENSE-notes file](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/LICENSE_notes.md) explaining why the data I used isn't public or in the repo
- a [project plan](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/project_plan_new.md) explaining the plans of the project/project idea.
- A pdf version of my [powerpoint presentation](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/CatsVsDogs.pdf)
- A [folder](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/tree/master/images) of all the graphs and other images created by the ipynb files
