## Overview
- This project aims to compare dog and cat tweets as well as certain dog and cat neologisms used in tweet hashtags. The main goal is to figure out popularity among cat and dog neologisms.
- More information [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/project_plan_new.md).

## What this repo includes:
- An ipynb file ([Doggos-vs-Kittehs](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/Doggos-vs-Kittehs.ipynb)) that shows data collection and the some analysis of the data
- A second ipynb file ([Doggos-vs-Kittehs-Part2](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/Doggos-vs-Kittehs-Part2.ipynb)) which is an extension of the first.
- An old ipynb file ([Project](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/Project.ipynb)) that is an older version of the first file listed above
- a [progress report](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/progress_report.md) of when I worked on things
- a [LIVE_data_collection](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/LIVE_data_collection.ipynb) ipynb file that let's you put in your own customerKey and customerSecret as well as topics to see how my data cleaning and part of my analysis works with a small dataset
- [LICENSE file](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/LICENSE.md) that describes the licensing for this repo
- [LICENSE-notes file](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/LICENSE_notes.md) explaining why the data I used isn't public or in the repo
- a [project plan](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter/blob/master/project_plan_new.md) explaining the plans of the project/project idea.
- A pdf version of my [powerpoint presentation]()
