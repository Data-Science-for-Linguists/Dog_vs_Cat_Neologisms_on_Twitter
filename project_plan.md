Data Science for Linguists  
Final Project  

## Idea
- Take a look at the differences between American Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language (BSL) common sign locations and sign space.
- Will use online dictionary corpora and use ELAN to encode the video dictionaries.
- ASL data will come from [National Center for Sign Language and Gesture Resources (NCSLGR) Corpus](http://www.bu.edu/asllrp/ncslgr-for-download/download-info.html)
- BSL data will come form [CAVA](http://www.bslcorpusproject.org/cava/)

## Plan
- I will use ELAN to annotate the videos and store the results in a DataFrame
- Then I will compare with numpy and matplotlib to show statistics and compare the data.
- This will be completed (hopefully) in a jupyter notebook that will also be found in this repository.
