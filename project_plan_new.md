Final Project  

## Idea
- Cats vs. Dogs on Twitter: Who is more popular?
- Comparing the amount of likes and also comparisons between neologisms for/about cats and dogs.
  - neologisms that will be compared:
    - dogs: "doggo" and "doge"
    - cats: "kitteh" and "toe beans"

## Plan
- I will use tweepy to gather data from Twitter on posts people have about cats and dogs.
- Then I will compare with numpy and matplotlib to show statistics and compare the data.
  - Compare when the neologism developed.
  - if a picture is present on the post or not
  - Compare location, number, and timezone.
  - Average length of the posts will also be compared.
  - If there is a particular user that posts more than others.
- This will be completed in a jupyter notebook that will also be found in this repository.
